        <h2 id="banner">About Us</h2>
        <p class="about">This website is a labor of love and only scratches the surface of my respect and passion for Independent Wrestling.  I was introduced to Independent Wrestling in 2015 when I went to my first Beyond Wrestling show in Providence, RI.  Over time I learned there were other companies such as Inter Species Wrestling and Chikara Pro, just to name a few.  I ventured to other shows and truly fell in love.  In 2017 my mom was diagnosed with Alzheimerâ€™s Dementia.  Independent Wrestling gave me a place to escape reality during this difficult time.  It was the one place that made me forget what was going on outside of those four ring posts.  I got lost in the comedy, the drama, the hardcore action.  I also gained an appreciation for what the wrestlers do, putting everything on the line making every moment count to give the fans a memory, or in my case a place to escape. </p>
        <br />
        <p class="about">My appreciation continues to grow immensely for all of the wrestlers and everyone involved in the independent wrestling scene.  Their passion for the art form, their respect for the business, and their determination to deliver the fans the best experience possible every show is what inspires IndyWrestling 411.  This is a small way to give back and show our appreciation to all of those in the Independent Wrestling scene.
